If you encounter problems with linking OpenCV on Visual Studio, make sure that same Runtime Library is selected for all components (it'll usually be Multi-threaded Debug DLL).
To check it out, go to Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library.
All linked libraries need to have same version. This includes:
- all local libraries
- Boost
- OpenCV and its dependencies
