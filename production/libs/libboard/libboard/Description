The board library is expected to allow the drawing of simple (and not
so simple, see below) vector graphics using the C++ language,
eventually exporting them as Encapsulated Postscript, SVG, or Xfig
files. Other file formats such as OpenDocument drawings may be nice in
future releases.

The main goal of the lib is to help two kind of users:

 - Programmers who want to include vector graphics exporting in some
applications, using a simple library with functions like drawLine()
drawRectangle() drawPolyline(), etc. without having to bother about
the SVG format or Postscript language. EPS, Xfig, and SVG are all
bundled in a self-sufficient lib.

 - Any user (beginner or not) who has basic C++ skills and wants do
draw complex figures which would be very difficult do build by hand
using a software like XFig or Inkscape, because they require lot of
primitives. In this case, the graphic may be C++-coded, with loops,
variables and so on, then maybe edited using a classical soft like the
ones mentioned before.

Eventually, since I built a first release of the current state of this
lib,  you may have a look at the following URL for a description, the
documentation, and some usage examples.

Hope it will fulfill your requirements, and apologies for my English ;-)

Thanks!
